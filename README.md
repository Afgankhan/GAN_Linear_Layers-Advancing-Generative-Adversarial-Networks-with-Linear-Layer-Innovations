# GAN_Linear_Layers-Advancing-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-with-Linear-Layer-Innovations
The project "GAN_Linear_Layers" represents a pioneering exploration into enhancing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through innovative implementations of linear layers. Leveraging PyTorch, this project delves into the realm of GANs, a powerful class of generative models. By introducing novel configurations and optimizations.
